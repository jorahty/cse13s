Assignment 4: The Circumnavigations of Denver Long

identify the shortest hamiltonian path,
and write the path and number of recursive calls to to an outfile.

DISCLAIMER

I helped my friends Bono (bwmirand) and Teresa (tqwu) with some parts
of this assignment, which should explain any unusual similarity in our code.
I made sure to stick to the rules
and do nothing that would be against class policy.

INSTRUCTIONS

To run the program:
1. Enter "make" into the command line. An executable file should appear.
2. Enter "./tsp -h" for the help message
