Dear Family,

Mars feels more like home every day. I was able to spot Earth in the night's sky last night. It's
strange having two moons. I can jump higher and everything is lighter. Sports are much more fun.
128 days from now I will be heading back to Earth. The councel is still deciding what the name of
the first Martian city should be.

Sincerley,

Joseph
